According to the ‘Vamana Purana’, the Varuna and the Assi rivers originated from the body of the primordial Person at the beginning of time itself. The tract of land lying between them is believed to be ‘Varanasi’, the holiest of all pilgrimages. The word ‘Kashi’ originated from the word ‘Kas’ which means to shine. Varanasi is also renowned for its rich tapestry of music, arts, crafts and education. Some of the world renowned exponents India has produced in these fields were schooled in Varanasi’s cultural ethos. Luminaries apart, Varanasi abounds in the art of silk weaving, an exotic work of art which manifests itself in precious Banarasi Silk Sarees and Silk brocades which are cherished as collector’s items across the world today.",

    "subtitle": "With more than 250 sport routes spread throughout the canyon, a Sonoran Desert ecosystem encased by the beautiful Mescal Mountains and scenic camping like nowhere else, the Homestead is a premier Arizona limestone sport climbing destination. A two-hour drive from either Phoenix or Tucson, located near the tiny desert community of Christmas, the Homestead provides day trips & longer visits with a feel of almost complete remoteness and desert ruggedness. The Homestead boasts a landscape with a rich community of desert plants, like saguaro cactus, ocotillo and mesquite all providing habitat for reclusive desert bighorn sheep. While most US limestone sport climbing destinations are off limits during the icy grips of winter, the Homestead is in its prime with sunny days and welcoming temperatures from November to February, making it ideal for winter excursions.
